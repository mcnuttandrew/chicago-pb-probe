00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:05,760
This is a demo of the design probe used in our 
interviews for the IEEE VIS 2024 submission, "What  

2
00:00:05,760 --> 00:00:11,560
can interactive visualization do for participatory 
budgeting in Chicago?" Hereafter, we refer to  

3
00:00:11,560 --> 00:00:17,760
participatory budgeting as PB. Participants first 
landed on this page which gives them information  

4
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:22,920
about the PB process in Chicago and gives the 
opportunity to enter a user ID for logging  

5
00:00:22,920 --> 00:00:30,400
interaction data. Our probe elicits preferences 
for proposed municipal projects in three stages:  

6
00:00:30,400 --> 00:00:36,800
sorting, allocating, and checking allocations. 
On the sort page, participants are introduced  

7
00:00:36,800 --> 00:00:42,680
to the proposed projects on the PB ballot. We 
pulled these projects descriptions and their  

8
00:00:42,680 --> 00:00:51,520
costs (which we reveal later) from a synthesis of 
actual PB ballots from previous years in Chicago.

9
00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:59,920
Participants can order and reorder 
projects using a flexible drag interaction.

10
00:01:14,280 --> 00:01:20,560
When the participant is happy with their sort 
order for all projects, they can move on.

11
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:25,400
On the allocation page, participants are asked 
to draw a distribution of funding by dragging  

12
00:01:25,400 --> 00:01:49,680
on the bars in the chart. Projects appear in 
the short order from the the previous page.

13
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:54,920
Participants can use the "clear" and "fill 
up" buttons to fine-tune their allocations,  

14
00:01:54,920 --> 00:01:59,840
exactly reaching a total 
budget amount of $1 million.

15
00:02:09,800 --> 00:02:14,880
On the check allocations page, the estimated 
cost of each project is revealed as rule  

16
00:02:14,880 --> 00:02:17,960
markings colored to indicate which 
projects have received sufficient  

17
00:02:17,960 --> 00:02:24,160
funding. The participant's allocations from 
the previous page persist. Participants have  

18
00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:28,840
the option of revising their allocation 
now that costs are known. Now a "set to  

19
00:02:28,840 --> 00:02:39,360
cost" button appears below each bar to 
aid in hitting the exact cost estimate.

20
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:41,520
Participants do not have enough money to fund all  

21
00:02:41,520 --> 00:02:48,680
projects fully so they have 
some hard choices to make.

22
00:02:48,680 --> 00:02:54,880
Participants fill out an 
optional demographic survey.

23
00:02:54,880 --> 00:03:00,240
The final page of the application provides 
a dashboard of simulated voting results. The  

24
00:03:00,240 --> 00:03:07,200
heatmap shows demographic data about voters in 
each ward versus the census. Participants can  

25
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:17,840
select different Wards to compare by clicking 
the map or by using the drop- down menu.

26
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:24,520
They can also view vote and census counts 
rather than normalized percentages. This  

27
00:03:24,520 --> 00:03:29,760
emphasizes how many people in the ward have 
voted rather than demographic representation.

28
00:03:31,400 --> 00:03:36,920
Participants can also view how people 
voted within and across wards. The strip  

29
00:03:36,920 --> 00:03:42,200
plot shows final allocations for categories 
of PB projects such as biking and transit  

30
00:03:42,200 --> 00:03:47,680
or streets and sidewalks, with each mark 
representing the allocations of one voter.  

31
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:52,600
PB projects are binned into categories 
to facilitate comparisons across wards,  

32
00:03:52,600 --> 00:03:56,240
where residents will have voted 
on different sets of projects. Our  

33
00:03:56,240 --> 00:04:01,800
intention was that voters might return to a 
page like this to monitor election results
