  How were the project proposals selected?
</h3>
<p class="my-2">
  All listed projects were suggested and vetted by 49th Ward residents. From
  August to September 2022, community representatives met regularly in
  committees to determine which project proposals to place on this yearâ€™s
  ballot.
</p>
<p class="my-2 italic">
  Participation in the 49th Ward participatory budgeting process as a community
  representative and/or as an attendee at a neighborhood assembly was entirely
  voluntary and open to all 49th Ward residents, regardless of citizenship or
  voter registration.
